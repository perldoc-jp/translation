Email::Sender::Transport - a role for email transports

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093380

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Email::Sender::Transport is a Moose role to aid in writing classes used to send
mail.  For the most part, its behavior comes entirely from the role
L<Email::Sender::Role::CommonSending>, which it includes. The important
difference is that Transports are often intended to be used by
L<Email::Sender::Simple>, and they provide two methods related to that purpose.

=for Pod::Coverage is_simple allow_partial_success

First, they provide an C<allow_partial_success> method which returns true or
false to indicate whether the transport will ever signal partial success.

Second, they provide an C<is_simple> method, which returns true if the
transport is suitable for use with Email::Sender::Simple.  By default, this
method returns the inverse of C<allow_partial_success>.

It is B<imperative> that these methods be accurate to prevent
Email::Sender::Simple users from sending partially successful transmissions.
Partial success is a complex case that almost all users will wish to avoid at
all times.
