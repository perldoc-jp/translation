=head1 NAME

Email::Sender - a library for sending email

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093380

=head1 OVERVIEW

Email::Sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic Email::Send library,
which did a decent job at handling very simple email sending tasks, but was not
suitable for serious use, for a variety of reasons.

Most users will be able to use L<Email::Sender::Simple> to send mail.  Users
with more specific needs should look at the available Email::Sender::Transport
classes.

Documentation may be found in L<Email::Sender::Manual>, and new users should
start with L<Email::Sender::Manual::QuickStart>.

=head1 IMPLEMENTING

Email::Sender itelf is a Moose role.  Any class that implements Email::Sender
is required to provide a method called C<send>.  This method should accept any
input that can be understood by L<Email::Abstract>, followed by a hashref
containing C<to> and C<from> arguments to be used as the envelope.  The method
should return an L<Email::Sender::Success> object on success or throw an
L<Email::Sender::Failure> on failure.
