=head1 NAME

=begin original

bigrat - Transparent BigNumber/BigRational support for Perl

=end original

bigrat - Perl 用の透過的な BigNumber/BigRational 対応

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use bigrat;

  print 2 + 4.5,"\n";			# BigFloat 6.5
  print 1/3 + 1/4,"\n";			# produces 7/12

  {
    no bigrat;
    print 1/3,"\n";			# 0.33333...
  }

  # Note that this will make hex() and oct() be globally overriden:
  use bigrat qw/hex oct/;
  print hex("0x1234567890123490"),"\n";
  print oct("01234567890123490"),"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

All operators (including basic math operations) are overloaded. Integer and
floating-point constants are created as proper BigInts or BigFloats,
respectively.

=end original

(基本算術演算子を含む)全ての演算子がオーバーロードされます。
整数定数と浮動小数点数定数はそれぞれ適切な BigInt または BigFloat として
作成されます。

=begin original

Other than L<bignum>, this module upgrades to Math::BigRat, meaning that
instead of 2.5 you will get 2+1/2 as output.

=head2 Modules Used

=begin original

C<bigrat> is just a thin wrapper around various modules of the Math::BigInt
family. Think of it as the head of the family, who runs the shop, and orders
the others to do the work.

Math::BigInt::Calc. This is equivalent to saying:

To supress this warning, use C<try> instead:

=head2 Sign

=begin original

The sign is either '+', '-', 'NaN', '+inf' or '-inf'.

=end original

The sign is either '+', '-', 'NaN', '+inf' or '-inf'.
(TBT)

=begin original

A sign of 'NaN' is used to represent the result when input arguments are not
numbers or as a result of 0/0. '+inf' and '-inf' represent plus respectively
minus infinity. You will get '+inf' when dividing a positive number by 0, and
'-inf' when dividing any negative number by 0.

=head2 Methods

=begin original

Since all numbers are not objects, you can use all functions that are part of
the BigInt or BigFloat API. It is wise to use only the bxxx() notation, and not
the fxxx() notation, though. This makes you independed on the fact that the
underlying object might morph into a different class than BigFloat.
