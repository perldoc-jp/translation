=begin original

bigint - Transparent BigInteger support for Perl

=end original

bigint - Perl 用の透過的な BigInteger 対応

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use bigint;

  $x = 2 + 4.5,"\n";			# BigInt 6
  print 2 ** 512,"\n";			# really is what you think it is
  print inf + 42,"\n";			# inf
  print NaN * 7,"\n";			# NaN
  print hex("0x1234567890123490"),"\n";	# Perl v5.9.4 or later

  {
    no bigint;
    print 2 ** 256,"\n";		# a normal Perl scalar now
  }

  # Note that this will be global:
  use bigint qw/hex oct/;
  print hex("0x1234567890123490"),"\n";
  print oct("01234567890123490"),"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

All operators (including basic math operations) are overloaded. Integer
constants are created as proper BigInts.

=end original

(基本算術演算子を含む)全ての演算子がオーバーロードされます。
整数定数は適切な BigInt として作成されます。

=begin original

Floating point constants are truncated to integer. All parts and results of
expressions are also truncated.

=end original

浮動小数点数定数は整数に切り詰められます。
式の全ての部分と結果も切り詰められます。

=begin original

Unlike L<integer>, this pragma creates integer constants that are only
limited in their size by the available memory and CPU time.

=end original

L<integer> と違って、このプラグマは利用可能なメモリと CPU 時間によってのみ
制限されるサイズの整数定数を作成します。

=head2 use integer vs. use bigint

=begin original

There is one small difference between C<use integer> and C<use bigint>: the
former will not affect assignments to variables and the return value of
some functions. C<bigint> truncates these results to integer too:

=begin original

In practice this makes seldom a difference as B<parts and results> of
expressions will be truncated anyway, but this can, for instance, affect the
return value of subroutines:

bigint recognizes some options that can be passed while loading it via use.
The options can (currently) be either a single letter form, or the long form.

A positive value rounds to this digit left from the dot. 0 or 1 mean round to

=head2 Internal Format

=begin original

The numbers are stored as objects, and their internals might change at anytime,
especially between math operations. The objects also might belong to different
classes, like Math::BigInt, or Math::BigInt::Lite. Mixing them together, even
with normal scalars is not extraordinary, but normal and expected.

(TBT)

=begin original

You should not depend on the internal format, all accesses must go through
accessor methods. E.g. looking at $x->{sign} is not a good idea since there
is no guaranty that the object in question has such a hash key, nor is a hash
underneath at all.

=head2 Sign

=begin original

The sign is either '+', '-', 'NaN', '+inf' or '-inf'.
You can access it with the sign() method.

=end original

The sign is either '+', '-', 'NaN', '+inf' or '-inf'.
You can access it with the sign() method.
(TBT)

=begin original

A sign of 'NaN' is used to represent the result when input arguments are not
numbers or as a result of 0/0. '+inf' and '-inf' represent plus respectively
minus infinity. You will get '+inf' when dividing a positive number by 0, and
'-inf' when dividing any negative number by 0.

=begin original

Since all numbers are now objects, you can use all functions that are part of
the BigInt API. You can only use the bxxx() notation, and not the fxxx()
notation, though.
