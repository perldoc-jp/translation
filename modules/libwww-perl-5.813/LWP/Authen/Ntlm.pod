LWP::Authen::Ntlm - Library for enabling NTLM authentication (Microsoft) in LWP

=end original

LWP::Authen::Ntlm - LWP で (Microsoft) NTLM 認証を有効にするライブラリ

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use LWP::UserAgent;
 use HTTP::Request::Common;
 my $url = 'http://www.company.com/protected_page.html';

 # Set up the ntlm client and then the base64 encoded ntlm handshake message
 my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent(keep_alive=>1);
 $ua->credentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

 $request = GET $url;
 print "--Performing request now...-----------\n";
 $response = $ua->request($request);
 print "--Done with request-------------------\n";

 if ($response->is_success) {print "It worked!->" . $response->code . "\n"}
 else {print "It didn't work!->" . $response->code . "\n"}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

C<LWP::Authen::Ntlm> allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are using the 
NTLM authentication scheme popularized by Microsoft.  This type of authentication is 
common on intranets of Microsoft-centric organizations.

The module takes advantage of the Authen::NTLM module by Mark Bush.  Since there 
is also another Authen::NTLM module available from CPAN by Yee Man Chan with an 
entirely different interface, it is necessary to ensure that you have the correct 
NTLM module.

In addition, there have been problems with incompatibilities between different 
versions of Mime::Base64, which Bush's Authen::NTLM makes use of.  Therefore, it is 
necessary to ensure that your Mime::Base64 module supports exporting of the 
encode_base64 and decode_base64 functions.

=head1 USAGE

=begin original

The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it directly in your 
code.  The LWP system will invoke the NTLM authentication when it encounters the 
authentication scheme while attempting to retrieve a URL from a server.  In order 
for the NTLM authentication to work, you must have a few things set up in your 
code prior to attempting to retrieve the URL:

The credentials must be set like this:

証明書は以下のようなものでなければなりません:

   $ua->credentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

=begin original

Note that you cannot use the HTTP::Request object's authorization_basic() method to set 
the credentials.  Note, too, that the 'www.company.com:80' portion only sets credentials 
on the specified port AND it is case-sensitive (this is due to the way LWP is coded, and 
has nothing to do with LWP::Authen::Ntlm)
