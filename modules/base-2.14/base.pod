in favor of the lighter-weight C<parent>.

=begin original

C<base> employs some heuristics to determine if a module has already been
loaded, if it has it doesn't try again. If C<base> tries to C<require> the
module it will not die if it cannot find the module's file, but will die on any
other error. After all this, should your base class be empty, containing no
symbols, it will die. This is useful for inheriting from classes in the same
file as yourself, like so:

If $VERSION is not detected even after loading it, <base> will define $VERSION
in the base package, setting it to the string C<-1, set by base.pm>.

C<base> will also initialize the fields if one of the base classes has it.
Multiple inheritance of fields is B<NOT> supported, if two or more base classes
each have inheritable fields the 'base' pragma will croak. See L<fields>,
L<public> and L<protected> for a description of this feature.

(診断メッセージ)

=over 4

=item Base class package "%s" is empty.

=begin original

base.pm was unable to require the base package, because it was not
found in your path.

=end original

base.pm was unable to require the base package, because it was not
found in your path.
(TBT)

=item Class 'Foo' tried to inherit from itself

=begin original

Attempting to inherit from yourself generates a warning.

=end original

自分自身を継承しようとすると警告が出ます。

    use Foo;

=head1 CAVEATS

(注意)
