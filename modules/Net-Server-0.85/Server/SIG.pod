Net::Server::SIG - adpf - Safer signal handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Server::SIG qw(register_sig check_sigs);
  use IO::Select ();
  use POSIX qw(WNOHANG);

  my $select = IO::Select->new();

  register_sig(PIPE => 'IGNORE',
               HUP  => 'DEFAULT',
               USR1 => sub { print "I got a SIG $_[0]\n"; },
               USR2 => sub { print "I got a SIG $_[0]\n"; },
               CHLD => sub { 1 while (waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) > 0); },
               );

  ### add some handles to the select
  $select->add(\*STDIN);

  ### loop forever trying to stay alive
  while ( 1 ){

    ### do a timeout to see if any signals got passed us
    ### while we were processing another signal
    my @fh = $select->can_read(10);

    my $key;
    my $val;

    ### this is the handler for safe (fine under unsafe also)
    if( &check_sigs() ){
      # or my @sigs = &check_sigs();
      next unless @fh;
    }

    my $handle = $fh[@fh];

    ### do something with the handle

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Signals in Perl 5 are unsafe.  Some future releases may be
able to fix some of this (ie Perl 5.8 or 6.0), but it would
be nice to have some safe, portable signal handling now.
Clarification - much of the time, signals are safe enough.
However, if the program employs forking or becomes a daemon
which can receive many simultaneous signals, then the 
signal handling of Perl is normally not sufficient for the
task.

Using a property of the select() function, Net::Server::SIG
attempts to fix the unsafe problem.  If a process is blocking on
select() any signal will short circuit the select.  Using
this concept, Net::Server::SIG does the least work possible (changing
one bit from 0 to 1).  And depends upon the actual processing
of the signals to take place immediately after the the select
call via the "check_sigs" function.  See the example shown
above and also see the sigtest.pl script located in the examples
directory of this distribution.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<register_sig($SIG =E<gt> \&code_ref)>

Takes key/value pairs where the key is the signal name, and the 
argument is either a code ref, or the words 'DEFAULT' or
'IGNORE'.  The function register_sig must be used in
conjuction with check_sigs, and with a blocking select() function
call -- otherwise, you will observe the registered signal
mysteriously vanish.

=item C<unregister_sig($SIG)>

Takes the name of a signal as an argument.  Calls register_sig
with a this signal name and 'DEFAULT' as arguments (same as
register_sig(SIG,'DEFAULT')

=item C<check_sigs()>

Checks to see if any registered signals have occured.  If so, it
will play the registered code ref for that signal.  Return value
is array containing any SIGNAL names that had occured.
