=head1 NAME

Net::Server::PreFork - Net::Server personality

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Server::PreFork;
  @ISA = qw(Net::Server::PreFork);

  sub process_request {
     #...code...
  }

  __PACKAGE__->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please read the pod on Net::Server and Net::Server::PreForkSimple
first.  This module is a personality, or extension, or sub class,
of the Net::Server::PreForkSimple class which is a sub class of
Net::Server.  See L<Net::Server::PreForkSimple>.

This personality binds to one or more ports and then forks
C<min_servers> child process.  The server will make sure
that at any given time there are C<min_spare_servers> available
to receive a client request, up to C<max_servers>.  Each of
these children will process up to C<max_requests> client
connections.  This type is good for a heavily hit site, and
should scale well for most applications.  (Multi port accept
is accomplished using flock to serialize the children).

=head1 SAMPLE CODE

Please see the sample listed in Net::Server.

=head1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

In addition to the command line arguments of the Net::Server
base class and the Net::Server::PreForkSimple parent class,
Net::Server::PreFork contains several other configurable
parameters.  You really should also see
L<Net::Server::PreForkSimple>.

  Key                 Value                   Default
  min_servers         \d+                     5
  min_spare_servers   \d+                     2
  max_spare_servers   \d+                     10
  max_servers         \d+                     50
  max_requests        \d+                     1000

  serialize           (flock|semaphore|pipe)  undef
  # serialize defaults to flock on multi_port or on Solaris
  lock_file           "filename"              POSIX::tmpnam

  child_communication 1                       undef

=over 4

=item min_servers

The minimum number of servers to keep running.

=item min_spare_servers

The minimum number of servers to have waiting for requests.
Minimum and maximum numbers should not be set to close to
each other or the server will fork and kill children too
often.

=item max_spare_servers

The maximum number of servers to have waiting for requests.
See I<min_spare_servers>.

=item max_servers

The maximum number of child servers to start.  This does not
apply to dequeue processes.

=item check_for_waiting

Seconds to wait before checking to see if we can kill
off some waiting servers.

=item child_communication

Enable child communication to parent via unix sockets.  If set
to true, will let children write to the socket contained in
$self->{server}->{parent_sock}.  The parent will be notified through
child_is_talking_hook where the first argument is the socket
to the child.  The child's socket is stored in
$self->{server}->{children}->{$child_pid}->{sock}.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

C<Net::Server::PreFork> allows for the use of a
configuration file to read in server parameters.  The format
of this conf file is simple key value pairs.  Comments and
white space are ignored.

  #-------------- file test.conf --------------

  ### server information
  min_servers   20
  max_servers   80
  min_spare_servers 10
  min_spare_servers 15

  max_requests  1000

  ### user and group to become
  user        somebody
  group       everybody

  ### logging ?
  log_file    /var/log/server.log
  log_level   3
  pid_file    /tmp/server.pid

  ### access control
  allow       .+\.(net|com)
  allow       domain\.com
  deny        a.+

  ### background the process?
  background  1

  ### ports to bind
  host        127.0.0.1
  port        localhost:20204
  port        20205

  ### reverse lookups ?
  # reverse_lookups on

  ### enable child communication ?
  # child_communication

  #-------------- file test.conf --------------

=head1 PROCESS FLOW

Process flow follows Net::Server until the loop phase.  At
this point C<min_servers> are forked and wait for
connections.  When a child accepts a connection, finishs
processing a client, or exits, it relays that information to
the parent, which keeps track and makes sure there are
enough children to fulfill C<min_servers>, C<min_spare_servers>,
C<max_spare_servers>, and C<max_servers>.

=head1 HOOKS

The PreFork server has the following hooks in addition
to the hooks provided by PreForkSimple.
See L<Net::Server::PreForkSimple>.

=over 4

=item C<$self-E<gt>parent_read_hook()>

This hook occurs any time that the parent reads information
from the child.  The line from the child is sent as an
argument.

=item C<$self-E<gt>child_is_talking_hook()>

This hook occurs if child_communication is true and the child
has written to $self->{server}->{parent_sock}.  The first argument
will be the open socket to the child.
