=head1 NAME

=begin original

mro - Method Resolution Order

=end original

mro - メソッド解決順序(Method Resolution Order)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use mro; # enables next::method and friends globally

  use mro 'dfs'; # enable DFS MRO for this class (Perl default)
  use mro 'c3'; # enable C3 MRO for this class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

The "mro" namespace provides several utilities for dealing
with method resolution order and method caching in general.

=end original

"mro" 名前空間はメソッド解決順序と一般的なメソッドキャッシュを扱うための
いくつかのユーティリティを提供します。

=begin original

These interfaces are only available in Perl 5.9.5 and higher.
See L<MRO::Compat> on CPAN for a mostly forwards compatible
implementation for older Perls.

=end original

これらのインターフェースは Perl 5.9.5 以上でのみ利用可能です。
より古い Perl でのほとんど前方互換実装については CPAN の L<MRO::Compat> を
参照してください。

=head1 OVERVIEW

(概観)

=begin original

It's possible to change the MRO of a given class either by using C<use
mro> as shown in the synopsis, or by using the L</mro::set_mro> function
below.  The functions in the mro namespace do not require loading the
C<mro> module, as they are actually provided by the core perl interpreter.

=end original

あるクラスでの MRO は、上述の C<use mro> を使うか、以下の L</mro::set_mro>
関数を使うことで変更できます。
mro 名前空間の関数は C<mro> モジュールを読み込む必要はなく、実際には
コア perl インタプリタによって提供されます。

=begin original

The special methods C<next::method>, C<next::can>, and
C<maybe::next::method> are not available until this C<mro> module
has been loaded via C<use> or C<require>.

=end original

特殊メソッド C<next::method>, C<next::can>, C<maybe::next::method> は
C<use> か C<require> によって C<mro> モジュールを読み込むまで
利用できません。

=head1 The C3 MRO

=begin original

In addition to the traditional Perl default MRO (depth first
search, called C<DFS> here), Perl now offers the C3 MRO as
well.  Perl's support for C3 is based on the work done in
Stevan Little's module L<Class::C3>, and most of the C3-related
documentation here is ripped directly from there.

=end original

伝統的な Perl のデフォルトの MRO (深さ優先探索; ここでは C<DFS> と
呼ばれます)にくわえて、Perl は C3 MRO も提供するようになりました。
Perl の C3 対応は Stevan Little による L<Class::C3> モジュールで行われた
作業を基としていて、ここにある C3 関係の文章のほとんどは、そこから直接
コピーされたものです。

=head2 What is C3?

(C3 って何?)

=begin original

C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method
resolution order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in
the language Dylan (see links in the L</"SEE ALSO"> section), and then
later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order) for the
new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as the
"canonical" MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot objects
as well.

=end original

C3 は多重継承における健全なメソッド解決順序を提供することを目的とした
アルゴリズムの名前です。
これは最初に Dylan と言う言語 (L</"SEE ALSO"> の章のリンクを
参照してください)、で導入され、後に Python 2.3 の新型のクラスでの
優先 MRO (Method Resolution Order; メソッド解決順序) として採用されました。
つい最近では Perl 6 のクラスでの「正統な」MRO として採用され、Parrot
プロジェクトでもデフォルトの MRO として採用されました。

=head2 How does C3 work

(C3 の動作)

=begin original

C3 works by always preserving local precendence ordering. This essentially
means that no class will appear before any of its subclasses. Take, for
instance, the classic diamond inheritance pattern:

=end original

C3 は常に局所的な優先順位を保存して動作します。
これは、基本的にどのクラスもそのサブクラスより先に現れることはないことを
意味します。
例えば、以下のような古典的なダイヤ型継承パターンを考えます:

     <A>
    /   \
  <B>   <C>
    \   /
     <D>

=begin original

The standard Perl 5 MRO would be (D, B, A, C). The result being that B<A>
appears before B<C>, even though B<C> is the subclass of B<A>. The C3 MRO
algorithm however, produces the following order: (D, B, C, A), which does
not have this issue.

=end original

標準の Perl 5 MRO は (D, B, A, C) です。
この結果、B<C> は B<A> のサブクラスにも関わらず、B<A> が B<C> より先に
検索されます。
しかし、C3 MRO アルゴリズムでは、(D, B, C, A) の順序になり、この問題は
ありません。

=begin original

This example is fairly trivial; for more complex cases and a deeper
explanation, see the links in the L</"SEE ALSO"> section.

=head1 Functions

=head2 mro::get_linear_isa($classname[, $type])

=begin original

Returns an arrayref which is the linearized MRO of the given class.
Uses whichever MRO is currently in effect for that class by default,
or the given MRO (either C<c3> or C<dfs> if specified as C<$type>).

=end original

=begin original

The linearized MRO of a class is an ordered array of all of the
classes one would search when resolving a method on that class,
starting with the class itself.

succeed, and return C<[ $classname ]>

Note that C<UNIVERSAL> (and any members of C<UNIVERSAL>'s MRO) are not
part of the MRO of a class, even though all classes implicitly inherit
methods from C<UNIVERSAL> and its parents.

=begin original

Sets the MRO of the given class to the C<$type> argument (either
C<c3> or C<dfs>).

=end original

Sets the MRO of the given class to the C<$type> argument (either
C<c3> or C<dfs>).

=end original

(TBT)

=head2 mro::get_isarev($classname)

=begin original

Gets the C<mro_isarev> for this class, returned as an
arrayref of class names.  These are every class that "isa"
the given class name, even if the isa relationship is
indirect.  This is used internally by the MRO code to
keep track of method/MRO cache invalidations.

(TBT)

=begin original

Currently, this list only grows, it never shrinks.  This
was a performance consideration (properly tracking and
deleting isarev entries when someone removes an entry
from an C<@ISA> is costly, and it doesn't happen often
anyways).  The fact that a class which no longer truly
"isa" this class at runtime remains on the list should be
considered a quirky implementation detail which is subject
to future change.  It shouldn't be an issue as long as
you're looking at this list for the same reasons the
core code does: as a performance optimization
over having to search every class in existence.

As with C<mro::get_mro> above, C<UNIVERSAL> is special.
C<UNIVERSAL> (and parents') isarev lists do not include

the given classname is either C<UNIVERSAL> itself,
or one of C<UNIVERSAL>'s parents by C<@ISA> inheritance.

if the class in question really isn't universal anymore.

=head2 mro::method_changed_in($classname)

=begin original

Invalidates the method cache of any classes dependent on the
given class.  This is not normally necessary.  The only
known case where pure perl code can confuse the method
cache is when you manually install a new constant
subroutine by using a readonly scalar value, like the
internals of L<constant> do.  If you find another case,
please report it so we can either fix it or document
the exception here.

Returns an integer which is incremented every time a

This is intended for authors of modules which do lots

changes in superclasses.

It's still up to you to seek out the actual changes,

This integer normally starts off at a value of C<1>
when a package stash is instantiated.  Calling it
on packages whose stashes do not exist at all will
return C<0>.  If a package stash is completely
deleted (not a normal occurence, but it can happen
if someone does something like C<undef %PkgName::>),
the number will be reset to either C<0> or C<1>,
depending on how completely package was wiped out.

=head2 next::method

=begin original

This is somewhat like C<SUPER>, but it uses the C3 method
resolution order to get better consistency in multiple
inheritance situations.  Note that while inheritance in
general follows whichever MRO is in effect for the
given class, C<next::method> only uses the C3 MRO.

C<__ANON__> and not C<foo> as you might expect. Since C<next::method> uses
C<caller> to find the name of the method it was called in, it will fail in
