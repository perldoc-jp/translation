=item actual arguments

=begin original

The L<scalar values|/scalar value> that you supply to a L</function>
or L</subroutine> when you call it.  For instance, when you call
C<power("puff")>, the string C<"puff"> is the actual argument.  See
also L</argument> and L</formal arguments>.

=item address operator

(アドレス演算子(address operator))

=begin original

Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but
this can be like playing with fire.  Perl provides a set of asbestos
gloves for handling all memory management.  The closest to an address
operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a L</hard
reference>, which is much safer than a memory address.

=item alias

(エイリアス(alias))

=begin original

A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though you'd
used the original name instead of the nickname.  Temporary aliases are
implicitly created in the loop variable for C<foreach> loops, in the
C<$_> variable for L<map|perlfunc/map> or L<grep|perlfunc/grep>
operators, in C<$a> and C<$b> during L<sort|perlfunc/sort>'s
comparison function, and in each element of C<@_> for the L</actual
arguments> of a subroutine call.  Permanent aliases are explicitly
created in L<packages|/package> by L<importing|/import> symbols or by
assignment to L<typeglobs|/typeglob>.  Lexically scoped aliases for
package variables are explicitly created by the L<our|perlfunc/our>
declaration.

"Would you like door A, B, or C?"  Alternatives in regular expressions
are separated with a single vertical bar: C<|>.  Alternatives in
normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical bar:
C<||>.  Logical alternatives in L</Boolean> expressions are separated
with either C<||> or C<or>.

=item architecture

(アーキテクチャ(architecture))

=begin original

The kind of computer you're working on, where one "kind" of computer
means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language.
Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable
images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture it's
running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are
compiled into machine code.  See also L</platform> and L</operating
system>.

ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit
codes best described as half ASCII.  See also L</Unicode>.

When Democritus gave the word "atom" to the indivisible bits of
matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut: I<a->
(not) + I<tomos> (cuttable).  An atomic operation is an action that
can't be interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.

=item autovivification

(自動有効化(autovivification))

=begin original

A Greco-Roman word meaning "to bring oneself to life".  In Perl,
storage locations (L<lvalues|/lvalue>) spontaneously generate
themselves as needed, including the creation of any L</hard reference>
values to point to the next level of storage.  The assignment
C<$a[5][5][5][5][5] = "quintet"> potentially creates five scalar
storage locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar
locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last
four scalar locations).  But the point of autovivification is that you
don't have to worry about it.

A substring L<captured|/capturing> by a subpattern within
unadorned parentheses in a L</regex>.  Backslashed decimal numbers
(C<\1>, C<\2>, etc.)  later in the same pattern refer back to the
corresponding subpattern in the current match.  Outside the pattern,
the numbered variables (C<$1>, C<$2>, etc.) continue to refer to these
same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of
the current dynamic scope.

(バックトラッキング(backtracking))

=begin original

The practice of saying, "If I had to do it all over, I'd do it
differently," and then actually going back and doing it all over
differently.  Mathematically speaking, it's returning from an
unsuccessful recursion on a tree of possibilities.  Perl backtracks
when it attempts to match patterns with a L</regular expression>, and
its earlier attempts don't pan out.  See L<perlre/Backtracking>.

Spanish dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money.
That's why a 25-cent piece today is still "two bits".)

the CPAN (which didn't exist at the time of Perl 5.0) can become the new

=begin original

A method of storing numbers in "scientific notation", such that the
precision of the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal
point "floats").  Perl does its numeric work with floating-point
numbers (sometimes called "floats"), when it can't get away with
using L<integers|/integer>.  Floating-point numbers are mere
approximations of real numbers.

A standard C library for doing L<buffered|/buffer> input and output to

machine.  Normally this only influences efficiency, not semantics.  If
your standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want it to
L</flush> the buffer more often, just set the C<$|> variable to a true

=begin original

A very large and constantly evolving language with several alternative

any way they choose, and usually do.  Speakers of this language think
it's easy to learn because it's so easily twisted to one's own ends,
but dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication nearly
impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of
the language.  To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer
must spend years of study in the art.  Many have abandoned this
discipline and now communicate via an Esperanto-like language called
Perl.
