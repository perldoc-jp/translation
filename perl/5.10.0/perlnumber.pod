=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

This document describes how Perl internally handles numeric values.

=end original

この文書は、Perl が内部で数値をどのように扱うかを記述します。

=begin original

Perl's operator overloading facility is completely ignored here.  Operator
overloading allows user-defined behaviors for numbers, such as operations
over arbitrarily large integers, floating points numbers with arbitrary
precision, operations over "exotic" numbers such as modular arithmetic or
p-adic arithmetic, and so on.  See L<overload> for details.

=head1 Storing numbers

(数値の保管)

=begin original

Perl can internally represent numbers in 3 different ways: as native
integers, as native floating point numbers, and as decimal strings.
Decimal strings may have an exponential notation part, as in C<"12.34e-56">.
I<Native> here means "a format supported by the C compiler which was used
to build perl".

=end original

Perl は内部的に数値を 3 つの異なった方法で表現できます: ネイティブな整数、
ネイティブな浮動小数点数、10 進文字列です。
10 進文字列は C<"12.34e-56"> のように指数部がある場合もあります。
ここでの I<ネイティブな> というのは、「perl をビルドする際に使われた C
コンパイラが対応している形式」を意味します。

=begin original

The term "native" does not mean quite as much when we talk about native
integers, as it does when native floating point numbers are involved.
The only implication of the term "native" on integers is that the limits for
the maximal and the minimal supported true integral quantities are close to
powers of 2.  However, "native" floats have a most fundamental
restriction: they may represent only those numbers which have a relatively
"short" representation when converted to a binary fraction.  For example,
0.9 cannot be represented by a native float, since the binary fraction
for 0.9 is infinite:

=end original

「ネイティブの」という用語はネイティブな整数に関して話すときにはほとんど
意味はなく、ネイティブな浮動小数点数に関わる際に意味があります。
整数に対して「ネイティブな」という用語が暗示する唯一のものは、
対応している真の整数量の最大値と最小値は 2 のべき乗に近いということです。
しかし、「ネイティブな」浮動小数点数は最も基本的な制限を持ちます:
they may represent only those numbers which have a relatively
"short" representation when converted to a binary fraction.
例えば、0.9 はネイティブな浮動小数点では表現できません; なぜなら 0.9 の
2 進数の分数は無限となるからです:

  binary0.1110011001100...

=begin original

with the sequence C<1100> repeating again and again.  In addition to this
limitation,  the exponent of the binary number is also restricted when it
is represented as a floating point number.  On typical hardware, floating
point values can store numbers with up to 53 binary digits, and with binary
exponents between -1024 and 1024.  In decimal representation this is close
to 16 decimal digits and decimal exponents in the range of -304..304.
The upshot of all this is that Perl cannot store a number like
12345678901234567 as a floating point number on such architectures without
loss of information.

=end original

C<1100> が繰り返されます。
この制限にくわえて、2 進数の指数も、浮動小数点数として表現されると
制限されます。
典型的なハードウェアでは、浮動小数点数は 53 桁までの 2 進数と、
-1024 から 1024 までの 2 進数指数を保管できます。
10 進表現では、ほぼ 16 桁の 10 進数と -304 から 304 の範囲の指数となります。
これら全ての結論は、このようなアーキテクチャでは、Perl は
12345678901234567 といった数を情報の欠落なしに浮動小数点数として
保管することはできないということです。

=begin original

Similarly, decimal strings can represent only those numbers which have a
finite decimal expansion.  Being strings, and thus of arbitrary length, there
is no practical limit for the exponent or number of decimal digits for these
numbers.  (But realize that what we are discussing the rules for just the
I<storage> of these numbers.  The fact that you can store such "large" numbers
does not mean that the I<operations> over these numbers will use all
of the significant digits.
See L<"Numeric operators and numeric conversions"> for details.)

=begin original

In fact numbers stored in the native integer format may be stored either
in the signed native form, or in the unsigned native form.  Thus the limits
for Perl numbers stored as native integers would typically be -2**31..2**32-1,
with appropriate modifications in the case of 64-bit integers.  Again, this
does not mean that Perl can do operations only over integers in this range:
it is possible to store many more integers in floating point format.

a finite decimal expansion or a "short" binary expansion.

=head1 Numeric operators and numeric conversions

(数値演算子と数値変換)

=begin original

As mentioned earlier, Perl can store a number in any one of three formats,
but most operators typically understand only one of those formats.  When
a numeric value is passed as an argument to such an operator, it will be
converted to the format understood by the operator.

=end original

前述のように、Perl は 3 つの形式のどれでも数値を格納できますが、
ほとんどの演算子は典型的にはこれらの形式の一つだけしか理解しません。
数値がそのような演算子の引数として渡されるとき、演算子が理解できる形式へ
変換されます。

=begin original

Six such conversions are possible:

=end original

6 種類のこのような変換が可能です:

  native integer        --> native floating point	(*)
  native integer        --> decimal string
  native floating_point --> native integer		(*)
  native floating_point --> decimal string		(*)
  decimal string        --> native integer
  decimal string        --> native floating point	(*)

=begin original

These conversions are governed by the following general rules:

=end original

これらの変換は、以下の一般的な規則に従います:

=begin original

If the C<< decimal string --> native integer >> conversion cannot be done
without loss of information, the result is compatible with the conversion
sequence C<< decimal_string --> native_floating_point --> native_integer >>.
In particular, rounding is strongly biased to 0, though a number like
C<"0.99999999999999999999"> has a chance of being rounded to 1.

=head1 Flavors of Perl numeric operations

(Perl の数値演算子の特色)

=begin original

Perl operations which take a numeric argument treat that argument in one
of four different ways: they may force it to one of the integer/floating/
string formats, or they may behave differently depending on the format of
the operand.  Forcing a numeric value to a particular format does not
change the number stored in the value.

change the number stored in the value.
(TBT)

=begin original

All the operators which need an argument in the integer format treat the
argument as in modular arithmetic, e.g., C<mod 2**32> on a 32-bit
architecture.  C<sprintf "%u", -1> therefore provides the same result as
C<sprintf "%u", ~0>.

(算術演算子)

=begin original

The binary operators C<+> C<-> C<*> C</> C<%> C<==> C<!=> C<E<gt>> C<E<lt>>
C<E<gt>=> C<E<lt>=> and the unary operators C<-> C<abs> and C<--> will
attempt to convert arguments to integers.  If both conversions are possible
without loss of precision, and the operation can be performed without
loss of precision then the integer result is used.  Otherwise arguments are
converted to floating point format and the floating point result is used.
The caching of conversions (as described above) means that the integer
conversion does not throw away fractional parts on floating point numbers.

=item Arithmetic operators during C<use integer>

=begin original

In scopes where C<use integer;> is in force, nearly all the operators listed
above will force their argument(s) into integer format, and return an integer
result.  The exceptions, C<abs>, C<++> and C<-->, do not change their
behavior with C<use integer;>

Though forcing an argument into a particular form does not change the
stored number, Perl remembers the result of such conversions.  In
particular, though the first such conversion may be time-consuming,
repeated operations will not need to redo the conversion.
