=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

This document is detailed notes on the Pod markup language.  Most
people will only have to read L<perlpod|perlpod> to know how to write
in Pod, but this document may answer some incidental questions to do
with parsing and rendering Pod.

In this document, "must" / "must not", "should" /
"should not", and "may" have their conventional (cf. RFC 2119)
meanings: "X must do Y" means that if X doesn't do Y, it's against
this specification, and should really be fixed.  "X should do Y"
means that it's recommended, but X may fail to do Y, if there's a
good reason.  "X may do Y" is merely a note that X can do Y at
will (although it is up to the reader to detect any connotation of
"and I think it would be I<nice> if X did Y" versus "it wouldn't
really I<bother> me if X did Y").

Notably, when I say "the parser should do Y", the
parser may fail to do Y, if the calling application explicitly
requests that the parser I<not> do Y.  I often phrase this as
"the parser should, by default, do Y."  This doesn't I<require>
the parser to provide an option for turning off whatever
feature Y is (like expanding tabs in verbatim paragraphs), although
it implicates that such an option I<may> be provided.

=head1 Pod Definitions

(Pod ¤ÎÄêµÁ)

=begin original

Pod is embedded in files, typically Perl source files, although you
can write a file that's nothing but Pod.

A B<line> in a file consists of zero or more non-newline characters,
terminated by either a newline or the end of the file.

=begin original

A B<newline sequence> is usually a platform-dependent concept, but
Pod parsers should understand it to mean any of CR (ASCII 13), LF
(ASCII 10), or a CRLF (ASCII 13 followed immediately by ASCII 10), in
addition to any other system-specific meaning.  The first CR/CRLF/LF
sequence in the file may be used as the basis for identifying the
newline sequence for parsing the rest of the file.

B<Whitespace> is used in this document as a blanket term for spaces,
tabs, and newline sequences.  (By itself, this term usually refers
to literal whitespace.  That is, sequences of whitespace characters
in Pod source, as opposed to "EE<lt>32>", which is a formatting
code that I<denotes> a whitespace character.)

A B<Pod parser> is a module meant for parsing Pod (regardless of
whether this involves calling callbacks or building a parse tree or
directly formatting it).  A B<Pod formatter> (or B<Pod translator>)
is a module or program that converts Pod to some other format (HTML,
plaintext, TeX, PostScript, RTF).  A B<Pod processor> might be a
formatter or translator, or might be a program that does something
else with the Pod (like counting words, scanning for index points,
etc.).

=for comment
 The current perlsyn says:
 [beginquote]
   Note that pod translators should look at only paragraphs beginning
   with a pod directive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler
   actually knows to look for pod escapes even in the middle of a
   paragraph.  This means that the following secret stuff will be ignored
   by both the compiler and the translators.
      $a=3;
      =secret stuff
       warn "Neither POD nor CODE!?"
      =cut back
      print "got $a\n";
   You probably shouldn't rely upon the warn() being podded out forever.
   Not all pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and perhaps
   the compiler will become pickier.
 [endquote]
 I think that those paragraphs should just be removed; paragraph-based
 parsing  seems to have been largely abandoned, because of the hassle
 with non-empty blank lines messing up what people meant by "paragraph".
 Even if the "it makes parsing easier" bit were especially true,
 it wouldn't be worth the confusion of having perl and pod2whatever
 actually disagree on what can constitute a Pod block.

=begin original

Within a Pod block, there are B<Pod paragraphs>.  A Pod paragraph
consists of non-blank lines of text, separated by one or more blank
lines.

In other words, the Pod processing handler for "head1" will apply the
same processing to "Did You Remember to CE<lt>use strict;>?" that it
would to an ordinary paragraph (i.e., formatting codes like
"CE<lt>...>") are parsed and presumably formatted appropriately, and

This command, which should occur early in the document (at least

an encoding name that L<Encode> recognizes.  (Encode's list

A document having more than one "=encoding" line should be
considered an error.  Pod processors may silently tolerate this if
the not-first "=encoding" lines are just duplicates of the
first one (e.g., if there's a "=encoding utf8" line, and later on
another "=encoding utf8" line).  But Pod processors should complain if
there are contradictory "=encoding" lines in the same document
(e.g., if there is a "=encoding utf8" early in the document and
"=encoding big5" later).  Pod processors that recognize BOMs
may also complain if they see an "=encoding" line
that contradicts the BOM (e.g., if a document with a UTF-16LE
BOM has an "=encoding shiftjis" line).

If a Pod processor sees any command other than the ones listed
above (like "=head", or "=haed1", or "=stuff", or "=cuttlefish",
or "=w123"), that processor must by default treat this as an
error.  It must not process the paragraph beginning with that
command, must by default warn of this as an error, and may
abort the parse.  A Pod parser may allow a way for particular
applications to add to the above list of known commands, and to
stipulate, for each additional command, whether formatting
codes should be processed.

do not signify whitespace, are merely part of the formatting codes
themselves.  That is, these are all synonymous:

If a Pod processor sees any formatting code other than the ones
listed above (as in "NE<lt>...>", or "QE<lt>...>", etc.), that
processor must by default treat this as an error.
A Pod parser may allow a way for particular
applications to add to the above list of known formatting codes;
a Pod parser might even allow a way to stipulate, for each additional
command, whether it requires some form of special processing, as
LE<lt>...> does.

=begin original

instead of as equivalent to a "C" formatting code containing 
only "$foo-", and then a "bar>" outside the "C" formatting code.  This
problem has since been solved by the addition of syntaxes like this:

Formatting codes absolutely cannot span paragraphs.  If a code is
opened in one paragraph, and no closing code is found by the end of
that paragraph, the Pod parser must close that formatting code,
and should complain (as in "Unterminated I code in the paragraph
starting at line 123: 'Time objects are not...'").  So these

Pod formatters should tolerate lines in verbatim blocks that are of
any length, even if that means having to break them (possibly several
times, for very long lines) to avoid text running off the side of the
page.  Pod formatters may warn of such line-breaking.  Such warnings
are particularly appropriate for lines are over 100 characters long, which
are usually not intentional.

Since Perl recognizes a Unicode Byte Order Mark at the start of files
as signaling that the file is Unicode encoded as in UTF-16 (whether
big-endian or little-endian) or UTF-8, Pod parsers should do the
same.  Otherwise, the character encoding should be understood as
being UTF-8 if the first highbit byte sequence in the file seems
valid as a UTF-8 sequence, or otherwise as Latin-1.

The well known Unicode Byte Order Marks are as follows:  if the
file begins with the two literal byte values 0xFE 0xFF, this is
the BOM for big-endian UTF-16.  If the file begins with the two
literal byte value 0xFF 0xFE, this is the BOM for little-endian
UTF-16.  If the file begins with the three literal byte values
0xEF 0xBB 0xBF, this is the BOM for UTF-8.

A naive but sufficient heuristic for testing the first highbit
byte-sequence in a BOM-less file (whether in code or in Pod!), to see
whether that sequence is valid as UTF-8 (RFC 2279) is to check whether
that the first byte in the sequence is in the range 0xC0 - 0xFD
I<and> whether the next byte is in the range
0x80 - 0xBF.  If so, the parser may conclude that this file is in
UTF-8, and all highbit sequences in the file should be assumed to
be UTF-8.  Otherwise the parser should treat the file as being
in Latin-1.  In the unlikely circumstance that the first highbit
sequence in a truly non-UTF-8 file happens to appear to be UTF-8, one
can cater to our heuristic (as well as any more intelligent heuristic)
by prefacing that line with a comment line containing a highbit
sequence that is clearly I<not> valid as UTF-8.  A line consisting
of simply "#", an e-acute, and any non-highbit byte,
is sufficient to establish this file's encoding.

 If/WHEN some brave soul makes these heuristics into a generic
 text-file class (or PerlIO layer?), we can presumably delete
 mention of these icky details from this file, and can instead
 tell people to just use appropriate class/layer.
 Auto-recognition of newline sequences would be another desirable
 feature of such a class/layer.

When rendering Pod to a format that allows comments (i.e., to nearly
any format other than plaintext), a Pod formatter must insert comment
text identifying its name and version number, and the name and
version numbers of any modules it might be using to process the Pod.
Minimal examples:

In cases of exceptionally aberrant documents, Pod parsers may abort the
parse.  Even then, using C<die>ing/C<croak>ing is to be avoided; where
possible, the parser library may simply close the input file

In paragraphs where formatting codes (like EE<lt>...>, BE<lt>...>)
are understood (i.e., I<not> verbatim paragraphs, but I<including>
ordinary paragraphs, and command paragraphs that produce renderable
text, like "=head1"), literal whitespace should generally be considered
"insignificant", in that one literal space has the same meaning as any
(nonzero) number of literal spaces, literal newlines, and literal tabs
(as long as this produces no blank lines, since those would terminate
the paragraph).  Pod parsers should compact literal whitespace in each
processed paragraph, but may provide an option for overriding this
(since some processing tasks do not require it), or may follow
additional special rules (for example, specially treating
period-space-space or period-newline sequences).

When rendering Pod to a format that has two kinds of hyphens (-), one
that's a non-breaking hyphen, and another that's a breakable hyphen
(as in "object-oriented", which can be split across lines as
"object-", newline, "oriented"), formatters are encouraged to
generally translate "-" to non-breaking hyphen, but may apply
heuristics to convert some of these to breaking hyphens.

Pod formatters should make reasonable efforts to keep words of Perl
code from being broken across lines.  For example, "Foo::Bar" in some
formatting systems is seen as eligible for being broken across lines
as "Foo::" newline "Bar" or even "Foo::-" newline "Bar".  This should
be avoided where possible, either by disabling all line-breaking in
mid-word, or by wrapping particular words with internal punctuation
in "don't break this across lines" codes (which in some formats may
not be a single code, but might be a matter of inserting non-breaking
zero-width spaces between every pair of characters in a word.)

Besides the well-known "EE<lt>lt>" and "EE<lt>gt>" codes for
less-than and greater-than, Pod parsers must understand "EE<lt>sol>"
for "/" (solidus, slash), and "EE<lt>verbar>" for "|" (vertical bar,
pipe).  Pod parsers should also understand "EE<lt>lchevron>" and
"EE<lt>rchevron>" as legacy codes for characters 171 and 187, i.e.,
"left-pointing double angle quotation mark" = "left pointing
guillemet" and "right-pointing double angle quotation mark" = "right
pointing guillemet".  (These look like little "<<" and ">>", and they
are now preferably expressed with the HTML/XHTML codes "EE<lt>laquo>"

Pod parsers should understand all "EE<lt>html>" codes as defined
in the entity declarations in the most recent XHTML specification at
C<www.W3.org>.  Pod parsers must understand at least the entities
that define characters in the range 160-255 (Latin-1).  Pod parsers,
when faced with some unknown "EE<lt>I<identifier>>" code,
shouldn't simply replace it with nullstring (by default, at least),
but may pass it through as a string consisting of the literal characters
E, less-than, I<identifier>, greater-than.  Or Pod parsers may offer the
alternative option of processing such unknown
"EE<lt>I<identifier>>" codes by firing an event especially
for such codes, or by adding a special node-type to the in-memory
document tree.  Such "EE<lt>I<identifier>>" may have special meaning
to some processors, or some processors may choose to add them to
a special error report.

Note that in all cases of "EE<lt>whatever>", I<whatever> (whether

alphanumeric characters -- that is, I<whatever> must watch

it contains spaces, which aren't alphanumeric characters.  This
presumably does not I<need> special treatment by a Pod processor;
" 0 1 2 3 " doesn't look like a number in any base, so it would
presumably be looked up in the table of HTML-like names.  Since
there isn't (and cannot be) an HTML-like entity called " 0 1 2 3 ",
this will be treated as an error.  However, Pod processors may
treat "EE<lt> 0 1 2 3 >" or "EE<lt>e-acute>" as I<syntactically>
invalid, potentially earning a different error message than the
error message (or warning, or event) generated by a merely unknown

This will likely require many formatters to have tables mapping from
treatable Unicode codepoints (such as the "\xE9" for the e-acute
character) to the escape sequences or codes necessary for conveying
such sequences in the target output format.  A converter to *roff
would, for example know that "\xE9" (whether conveyed literally, or via
a EE<lt>...> sequence) is to be conveyed as "e\\*'".
Similarly, a program rendering Pod in a Mac OS application window, would
presumably need to know that "\xE9" maps to codepoint 142 in MacRoman
encoding that (at time of writing) is native for Mac OS.  Such
Unicode2whatever mappings are presumably already widely available for
common output formats.  (Such mappings may be incomplete!  Implementers
are not expected to bend over backwards in an attempt to render
Cherokee syllabics, Etruscan runes, Byzantine musical symbols, or any
of the other weird things that Unicode can encode.)  And
if a Pod document uses a character not found in such a mapping, the
formatter should consider it an unrenderable character.

If, surprisingly, the implementor of a Pod formatter can't find a
satisfactory pre-existing table mapping from Unicode characters to
escapes in the target format (e.g., a decent table of Unicode
characters to *roff escapes), it will be necessary to build such a
table.  If you are in this circumstance, you should begin with the
characters in the range 0x00A0 - 0x00FF, which is mostly the heavily
used accented characters.  Then proceed (as patience permits and
fastidiousness compels) through the characters that the (X)HTML
standards groups judged important enough to merit mnemonics
for.  These are declared in the (X)HTML specifications at the
www.W3.org site.  At time of writing (September 2001), the most recent
entity declaration files are:

It is up to individual Pod formatter to display good judgement when
confronted with an unrenderable character (which is distinct from an
unknown EE<lt>thing> sequence that the parser couldn't resolve to
anything, renderable or not).  It is good practice to map Latin letters
with diacritics (like "EE<lt>eacute>"/"EE<lt>233>") to the corresponding
unaccented US-ASCII letters (like a simple character 101, "e"), but
clearly this is often not feasible, and an unrenderable character may
be represented as "?", or the like.  In attempting a sane fallback
(as from EE<lt>233> to "e"), Pod formatters may use the
%Latin1Code_to_fallback table in L<Pod::Escapes|Pod::Escapes>, or
L<Text::Unidecode|Text::Unidecode>, if available.

Some Pod formatters output to formats that implement non-breaking
spaces as an individual character (which I'll call "NBSP"), and
others output to formats that implement non-breaking spaces just as
spaces wrapped in a "don't break this across lines" code.  Note that
at the level of Pod, both sorts of codes can occur: Pod can contain a
NBSP character (whether as a literal, or as a "EE<lt>160>" or
"EE<lt>nbsp>" code); and Pod can contain "SE<lt>foo
IE<lt>barE<gt> baz>" codes, where "mere spaces" (character 32) in
such codes are taken to represent non-breaking spaces.  Pod
parsers should consider supporting the optional parsing of "SE<lt>foo
IE<lt>barE<gt> baz>" as if it were
"fooI<NBSP>IE<lt>barE<gt>I<NBSP>baz", and, going the other way, the
optional parsing of groups of words joined by NBSP's as if each group
were in a SE<lt>...> code, so that formatters may use the
representation that maps best to what the output format demands.

Some processors may find that the C<SE<lt>...E<gt>> code is easiest to
implement by replacing each space in the parse tree under the content
of the S, with an NBSP.  But note: the replacement should apply I<not> to
spaces in I<all> text, but I<only> to spaces in I<printable> text.  (This
distinction may or may not be evident in the particular tree/event
model implemented by the Pod parser.)  For example, consider this
unusual case:

Besides the NBSP character discussed above, implementors are reminded
of the existence of the other "special" character in Latin-1, the
"soft hyphen" character, also known as "discretionary hyphen",
i.e. C<EE<lt>173E<gt>> = C<EE<lt>0xADE<gt>> =
C<EE<lt>shyE<gt>>).  This character expresses an optional hyphenation
point.  That is, it normally renders as nothing, but may render as a
"-" if a formatter breaks the word at that point.  Pod formatters
should, as appropriate, do one of the following:  1) render this with
a code with the same meaning (e.g., "\-" in RTF), 2) pass it through
in the expectation that the formatter understands this character as
such, or 3) delete it.

Îã¤¨¤Ð:

These signal to a formatter that if it is to hyphenate "sigaction"
or "manuscript", then it should be done as
"sig-I<[linebreak]>action" or "manu-I<[linebreak]>script"
(and if it doesn't hyphenate it, then the C<EE<lt>shyE<gt>> doesn't
show up at all).  And if it is
to hyphenate "Jarkko" and/or "Hietaniemi", it can do
so only at the points where there is a C<EE<lt>shyE<gt>> code.

effect with a for or begin/end sequence: "=for biblio ..." or "=begin

Throughout this document, "Pod" has been the preferred spelling for
the name of the documentation format.  One may also use "POD" or
"pod".  For the documentation that is (typically) in the Pod
format, you may use "pod", or "Pod", or "POD".  Understanding these
distinctions is useful; but obsessing over how to spell them, usually
is not.

In case of LE<lt>...> codes with no "text|" part in them,
older formatters have exhibited great variation in actually displaying
the link or cross reference.  For example, LE<lt>crontab(5)> would render
as "the C<crontab(5)> manpage", or "in the C<crontab(5)> manpage"
or just "C<crontab(5)>".

Previous versions of perlpod distinguished C<LE<lt>name/"section"E<gt>>
links from C<LE<lt>name/itemE<gt>> links (and their targets).  These
have been merged syntactically and semantically in the current
specification, and I<section> can refer either to a "=headI<n> Heading
Content" command or to a "=item Item Content" command.  This
specification does not specify what behavior should be in the case
of a given document having several things all seeming to produce the
same I<section> identifier (e.g., in HTML, several things all producing
the same I<anchorname> in <a name="I<anchorname>">...</a>
elements).  Where Pod processors can control this behavior, they should
use the first such anchor.  That is, C<LE<lt>Foo/BarE<gt>> refers to the
I<first> "Bar" section in Foo.

At time of writing, C<LE<lt>nameE<gt>> values are of two types:
either the name of a Pod page like C<LE<lt>Foo::BarE<gt>> (which
might be a real Perl module or program in an @INC / PATH
directory, or a .pod file in those places); or the name of a Unix
man page, like C<LE<lt>crontab(5)E<gt>>.  In theory, C<LE<lt>chmodE<gt>>
in ambiguous between a Pod page called "chmod", or the Unix man page
"chmod" (in whatever man-section).  However, the presence of a string
in parens, as in "crontab(5)", is sufficient to signal that what
is being discussed is not a Pod page, and so is presumably a
Unix man page.  The distinction is of no importance to many
Pod processors, but some processors that render to hypertext formats
may need to distinguish them in order to know how to render a
given C<LE<lt>fooE<gt>> code.

Previous versions of perlpod allowed for a C<LE<lt>sectionE<gt>> syntax (as in
C<LE<lt>Object AttributesE<gt>>), which was not easily distinguishable from
C<LE<lt>nameE<gt>> syntax and for C<LE<lt>"section"E<gt>> which was only
slightly less ambiguous.  This syntax is no longer in the specification, and
has been replaced by the C<LE<lt>/sectionE<gt>> syntax (where the slash was
formerly optional).  Pod parsers should tolerate the C<LE<lt>"section"E<gt>>
syntax, for a while at least.  The suggested heuristic for distinguishing
C<LE<lt>sectionE<gt>> from C<LE<lt>nameE<gt>> is that if it contains any
whitespace, it's a I<section>.  Pod processors should warn about this being
deprecated syntax.

=begin original

The non-zero numeric I<indentlevel> in "=over I<indentlevel>" ...
"=back" is used for giving the formatter a clue as to how many
"spaces" (ems, or roughly equivalent units) it should tab over,
although many formatters will have to convert this to an absolute
measurement that may not exactly match with the size of spaces (or M's)
in the document's base font.  Other formatters may have to completely
ignore the number.  The lack of any explicit I<indentlevel> parameter is
equivalent to an I<indentlevel> value of 4.  Pod processors may
complain if I<indentlevel> is present but is not a positive number
matching C<m/\A(\d*\.)?\d+\z/>.

Authors of Pod formatters are reminded that "=over" ... "=back" may
map to several different constructs in your output format.  For
example, in converting Pod to (X)HTML, it can map to any of
<ul>...</ul>, <ol>...</ol>, <dl>...</dl>, or
<blockquote>...</blockquote>.  Similarly, "=item" can map to <li> or
<dt>.

Authors of Pod formatters should note that this construct:

  velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut
  labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

  =item Ut Enim

=begin original

is semantically ambiguous, in a way that makes formatting decisions
a bit difficult.  On the one hand, it could be mention of an item
"Neque", mention of another item "Porro", and mention of another
item "Quisquam Est", with just the last one requiring the explanatory
paragraph "Qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor..."; and then an item
"Ut Enim".  In that case, you'd want to format it like so:

=end original

    velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut
    labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

  Ut Enim

=begin original

But it could equally well be a discussion of three (related or equivalent)
items, "Neque", "Porro", and "Quisquam Est", followed by a paragraph
explaining them all, and then a new item "Ut Enim".  In that case, you'd
probably want to format it like so:

=end original

    velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut
    labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

  Ut Enim

=begin original

But (for the foreseeable future), Pod does not provide any way for Pod
authors to distinguish which grouping is meant by the above
"=item"-cluster structure.  So formatters should format it like so:

=end original

¤·¤«¤·(Í½Â¬²ÄÇ½¤ÊÌ¤Íè¤Ë¤ª¤¤¤Æ)¡¢Pod ¤Ï Pod ºî¼Ô¤Ë¾å½Ò¤Î "=item" ¤Î

  Ut Enim

=begin original

That is, there should be (at least roughly) equal spacing between
items as between paragraphs (although that spacing may well be less
than the full height of a line of text).  This leaves it to the reader
to use (con)textual cues to figure out whether the "Qui dolorem
ipsum..." paragraph applies to the "Quisquam Est" item or to all three
items "Neque", "Porro", and "Quisquam Est".  While not an ideal
situation, this is preferable to providing formatting cues that may
be actually contrary to the author's intent.

(¥Ç¡¼¥¿ÃÊÍî¤È "=begin/=end" ÎÎ°è¤Ë¤Ä¤¤¤Æ)

=begin original

Data paragraphs are typically used for inlining non-Pod data that is
to be used (typically passed through) when rendering the document to
a specific format:

=end original

¥Ç¡¼¥¿ÃÊÍî¤ÏÅµ·¿Åª¤Ë¤ÏÊ¸½ñ¤òÆÃÄê¤Î¥Õ¥©¡¼¥Þ¥Ã¥È¤Ç¥ì¥ó¥À¥ê¥ó¥°¤¹¤ë¤È¤­¤Ë

  =begin rtf

  \par{\pard\qr\sa4500{\i Printed\~\chdate\~\chtime}\par}

  =end rtf

=begin original

The exact same effect could, incidentally, be achieved with a single
"=for" paragraph:

=end original

  =for rtf \par{\pard\qr\sa4500{\i Printed\~\chdate\~\chtime}\par}

=begin original

(Although that is not formally a data paragraph, it has the same
meaning as one, and Pod parsers may parse it as one.)

=end original

(¤³¤ì¤Ï·Á¼°Åª¤Ë¤Ï¥Ç¡¼¥¿ÃÊÍî¤Ç¤Ï¤¢¤ê¤Þ¤»¤ó¤¬¡¢Æ±¤¸°ÕÌ£¤ò»ý¤Á¡¢

  =begin html

  I like <em>PIE</em>!

  <hr>Especially pecan pie!

  =end html

=begin original

If these were ordinary paragraphs, the Pod parser would try to
expand the "EE<lt>/em>" (in the first paragraph) as a formatting
code, just like "EE<lt>lt>" or "EE<lt>eacute>".  But since this
is in a "=begin I<identifier>"..."=end I<identifier>" region I<and>
the identifier "html" doesn't begin have a ":" prefix, the contents
of this region are stored as data paragraphs, instead of being
processed as ordinary paragraphs (or if they began with a spaces
and/or tabs, as verbatim paragraphs).

As a further example: At time of writing, no "biblio" identifier is
supported, but suppose some processor were written to recognize it as
a way of (say) denoting a bibliographic reference (necessarily
containing formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs).  The fact that
"biblio" paragraphs were meant for ordinary processing would be
indicated by prefacing each "biblio" identifier with a colon:

This would signal to the parser that paragraphs in this begin...end
region are subject to normal handling as ordinary/verbatim paragraphs
(while still tagged as meant only for processors that understand the
"biblio" identifier).  The same effect could be had with:

=begin original

The ":" on these identifiers means simply "process this stuff
normally, even though the result will be for some special target".
I suggest that parser APIs report "biblio" as the target identifier,
but also report that it had a ":" prefix.  (And similarly, with the
above "html", report "html" as the target identifier, and note the

The contents of the above "=begin :yetanotherformat" ...

the immediately containing region's identifier (":yetanotherformat")
begins with a colon.  In practice, most regions that contain
data paragraphs will contain I<only> data paragraphs; however, 
the above nesting is syntactically valid as Pod, even if it is
rare.  However, the handlers for some formats, like "html",
will accept only data paragraphs, not nested regions; and they may
complain if they see (targeted for them) nested regions, or commands,
other than "=end", "=pod", and "=cut".

Pod parsers, when processing a series of data paragraphs one

be one large data paragraph that happens to contain blank lines.  So
the content of the above "=begin html"..."=end html" I<may> be stored
as two data paragraphs (one consisting of

Incidentally, note that there's no easy way to express a data
paragraph starting with something that looks like a command.  Consider:

=end original

¤È¤³¤í¤Ç¡¢¥³¥Þ¥ó¥É¤Î¤è¤¦¤Ë¸«¤¨¤ë¤â¤Î¤Ç»Ï¤Þ¤ë¥Ç¡¼¥¿ÃÊÍî¤òµ­½Ò¤¹¤ë´ÊÃ±¤Ê

°Ê²¼¤ò¹Í¤¨¤Þ¤¹:

  =begin stuff

  =shazbot

  =end stuff

=begin original

There, "=shazbot" will be parsed as a Pod command "shazbot", not as a data
paragraph "=shazbot\n".  However, you can express a data paragraph consisting
of "=shazbot\n" using this code:

=end original

¤³¤³¤Ç¡¢"=shazbot" ¤Ï¥Ç¡¼¥¿ÃÊÍî "=shazbot\n" ¤Ç¤Ï¤Ê¤¯ Pod ¥³¥Þ¥ó¥É

  =for stuff =shazbot

=begin original

The situation where this is necessary, is presumably quite rare.

=end original

¤³¤ì¤¬É¬Í×¤Ê¾õ¶·¤Ï¡¢¤ª¤½¤é¤¯¤«¤Ê¤êµ©¤Ç¤¹¡£

=begin original

Note that =end commands must match the currently open =begin command.  That
is, they must properly nest.  For example, this is valid:

=end original

¤Ê¤ª¡¢=end ¥³¥Þ¥ó¥É¤Ï¸½ºß³«¤¤¤Æ¤¤¤ë =begin ¥³¥Þ¥ó¥É¤È
°ìÃ×¤·¤Ê¤±¤ì¤Ð¤Ê¤é¤Ê¤¤¤³¤È¤ËÃí°Õ¤·¤Æ¤¯¤À¤µ¤¤¡£

Îã¤¨¤Ð¡¢°Ê²¼¤ÏÀµÅö¤Ç¤¹:

  =begin outer

  X

  =begin inner

  Y

  =end inner

  Z

  =end outer

=begin original

while this is invalid:

=end original

°ìÊý¡¢°Ê²¼¤ÏÉÔÀµ¤Ç¤¹:

  =begin outer

  X

  =begin inner

  Y

  =end outer

  Z

  =end inner

=begin original

This latter is improper because when the "=end outer" command is seen, the
currently open region has the formatname "inner", not "outer".  (It just
happens that "outer" is the format name of a higher-up region.)  This is
an error.  Processors must by default report this as an error, and may halt
processing the document containing that error.  A corollary of this is that
regions cannot "overlap". That is, the latter block above does not represent
a region called "outer" which contains X and Y, overlapping a region called
"inner" which contains Y and Z.  But because it is invalid (as all
apparently overlapping regions would be), it doesn't represent that, or
anything at all.
