perlreapi - perl regular expression plugin interface

perlreapi - perl 正規表現プラグインインターフェース

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using other
regular expression engines than the default one.

=end original

Perl 5.9.5 から、デフォルトと異なるその他の正規表現エンジンを使うための
新しいインターフェスがあります。

=begin original

Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the
following format:

=begin original

When a regexp is compiled, its C<engine> field is then set to point at
the appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find
the right routines to do so.

=end original

正規表現がコンパイルされるとき、C<engine> フィールドが適切な構造体を
指すように設定されるので、使われる必要があるとき、Perl はそうするための
正しいルーチンを見つけられます。

=begin original

In order to install a new regexp handler, C<$^H{regcomp}> is set
to an integer which (when casted appropriately) resolves to one of these
structures. When compiling, the C<comp> method is executed, and the
resulting regexp structure's engine field is expected to point back at
the same structure.

The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by perl under threading
to provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back to
the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all
routines get an extra argument.

    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);

=begin original

Compile the pattern stored in C<pattern> using the given C<flags> and
return a pointer to a prepared C<REGEXP> structure that can perform
the match. See L</The REGEXP structure> below for an explanation of
the individual fields in the REGEXP struct.

The C<pattern> parameter is the scalar that was used as the
pattern. previous versions of perl would pass two C<char*> indicating
the start and end of the stringified pattern, the following snippet can
be used to get the old parameters:

=begin original

Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern it's possible to implement
an engine that does something with an array (C<< "ook" =~ [ qw/ eek
hlagh / ] >>) or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular
expression (C<< "ook" =~ qr/eek/ >>). perl's own engine will always
stringify everything using the snippet above but that doesn't mean
other engines have to.

The C<eogc> flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp
routine. The regex engine does not need to know whether any of these
are set as those flags should only affect what perl does with the
pattern and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and
executed.

By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have

In general the flags should be preserved in C<< rx->extflags >> after

some of them to invoke or disable some special behavior in perl. The
flags along with any special behavior they cause are documented below:
